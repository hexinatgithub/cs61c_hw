4) 65 125



P2 - Clock Frequency
1) Not work properly, 1ns Si will change but hold time should at least 2ns
2) clk-to-q: 3ns; adder 1ns + 1ns; register setup time 2ns. Total: 7ns. Maximum clock frequency: 142 MHz
3) First add up Xi and Yi, then add up the previous result and Si-1 so we get Si. In this diagram, total delay includes clk-to-q: 3ns, adder propagation: 1ns, register setup time 2ns. Total: 6ns.
